 # # Understanding Project Milestones and Project Tasks

As a project manager, it's essential to understand the difference between project milestones and project tasks. Project milestones are checkpoints that indicate progress and completion of a deliverable or phase of the project, while project tasks are activities that must be completed within a set period to achieve a milestone. Tasks ladder up to milestones, making them crucial for project tracking and management.

# Why Setting Milestones in Your Project is Important

Setting milestones is essential to understand project requirements, keep the project on track, adjust scope, timelines, or resources, motivate your team, and demonstrate progress to stakeholders. Each milestone must be completed on time and sequentially, as they depend on completing associated project tasks. 

# The Importance of Milestones in Your Project

Milestones provide an overview of the amount of work required, keep your project on track, motivate your team, and show progress to stakeholders. Identifying milestones requires evaluating the project as a whole, pinpointing where the project achieves major goals. Milestones should be spaced out accordingly to give your team enough time to complete each task.

# Best Practices for Setting Milestones as a Project Manager

Setting milestones requires sorting tasks and milestones in a hierarchy, breaking down tasks into manageable chunks, and integrating milestones into your project schedule. The number of milestones is not fixed, and it's best to set them for significant moments in the project. Avoid setting too many milestones, mistaking tasks for milestones, or listing milestones and tasks separately.

# How to Break Down Tasks and Assign Them for Project Success

Breaking down projects into manageable tasks and assigning them effectively is critical for project success. Creating a work breakdown structure (WBS) is a helpful tool that sorts milestones and tasks into a hierarchy, making them less daunting. Assign tasks according to a person's role in the project, familiarity with the tasks, workload, and make it clear who's doing what by when.

# An Introduction to Work Breakdown Structures (WBS)

A work breakdown structure (WBS) is a tool that sorts the milestones and tasks of a project into a hierarchy in the order they need to be completed. A thorough WBS gives a visual representation of a project and the tasks required to deliver each milestone, making it easier to understand the essential project tasks, estimate costs, develop a schedule, assign roles and responsibilities, and track progress. Building a WBS requires starting with the high-level, overarching project picture, identifying tasks to meet milestones, and examining those tasks and breaking them down further into sub-tasks.
 # # Importance of Planning in Project Management

Many projects fail because of a lack of proper planning. In this article, we will discuss the importance of planning in project management based on insights shared by Clennita, a Senior Engineering Program Manager at Google.
