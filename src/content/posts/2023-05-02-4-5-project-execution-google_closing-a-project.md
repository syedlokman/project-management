  Closing a project is a crucial phase in project management that involves
  completing all work, following all agreed-upon project management processes,
  and receiving formal recognition from stakeholders. Skipping any of these
  steps can lead to devastating consequences, as demonstrated by the case study
  of Tilly's Toys, a children's toy manufacturer that incurred significant costs
  and incurred legal risk due to oversights in project closure. To avoid these
  repercussions, project managers must plan for the closing phase just as they
  plan for the other phases of the project life cycle.

# The Importance of Properly Closing a Project

Managing a project involves more than just executing tasks and meeting deadlines. The final phase of the project life cycle, which involves closing the project, is crucial. In this article, we'll discuss the impact of skipping important project closure steps and provide a case study to illustrate this point.

## The Importance of Closing a Project

Closing a project involves ensuring that all work has been completed, all agreed-upon project management processes have been executed, and formal recognition and agreement have been received from stakeholders. Skipping any of these steps can compromise a project that had otherwise been running smoothly.

## Case Study: Tilly's Toys

A case study of a small children's toy manufacturer called Tilly's Toys helps to understand the impact of skipping important project closure steps. Tilly's Toys developed a new interactive piggy bank for children to learn counting and adding. However, several oversights occurred due to not properly closing out the project.

### Oversight #1: Not all work was completed

Boxes were made for the toy, but they didn't include a safety disclaimer indicating that the toy includes small parts and may not be suitable for children under the age of three. Tilly's Toys had to create new boxes with the disclaimer, incurring significant costs and delaying the launch date.

### Oversight #2: An important agreed-upon project management process was not completed

A contracted educational expert was not given a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), and they posted about the toy on social media months before its launch, putting Tilly's Toys at legal risk.

### Oversight #3: Stakeholders and the project manager did not provide formal recognition and agreement that the project was done

The project manager released his team to work on other projects, but the customer later sent a list of additional changes they wanted to see in the toy's design. The project manager had to tell the customer that it was too late to implement their design requests, leading to dissatisfaction and a risk of losing the customer.

## Avoiding the Impact of Project Closure Oversights

Skipping steps in the closing phase can impact launch dates, legal risk, financial losses, team credibility, and relationship with the customer or client. To avoid these issues, plan for the closure phase just like the other project lifecycle phases.

# Welcome to Our New Module: Learning to Close a Project

The new module covers the importance of project closure and how to do it effectively. It explores several topics such as why project closure is important, how to determine when a project is complete, the project closing process, and much more.

## The Importance of Closing a Project

This section highlights why project closure is a critical part of the project management process. It provides the benefits of closing a project such as avoiding unfavorable scenarios, ensuring proper stakeholder, and client involvement and allowing the team to celebrate their success.

## Completing Vs. Closing a Project

This section covers the differences between completing and closing a project. It discusses how effective project managers view project closure as a vital step in the process of creating successful projects.

## Stakeholder and Client Involvement in the Closing Process

This section explores how project managers can ensure that stakeholders and clients are properly involved in the closing process. It provides some advantages of stakeholder and client involvement and how to manage potential risks.

## Involving Your Team in the Closing Process

This section explains how to collaborate with your team to close a project effectively. It covers a range of strategies for involving your team in the closing process.

## Project Closure for Project Managers

This section explores the specific tasks for project managers to oversee the entire project closure process. It provides guidance on creating presentations and documentation that wrap up the project effectively, ensuring all loose ends are tied up, and stakeholders are satisfied with the outcomes of the project.
 # # The Importance of Closing Processes for Clients and Stakeholders 

Proper project closure is essential for clients and stakeholders, as it ensures that their needs were met and the project was completed as intended. A formal closing process helps maintain credibility and positive relationships with stakeholders. To determine the appropriate closing process, project managers need to ask if the milestone is final and if a small closing process is sufficient or if a comprehensive closing phase is needed.

## Conducting the Closing Process

During the closing process, the project manager determines if the project achieved its strategic goals and if the quality of deliverables met stakeholder satisfaction. The administrative closure of the procurement process, contract closure, and payments to vendors all occur during this process. Regaining final deliverables, conducting surveys, and gathering feedback are necessary follow-up tasks.

## Demonstrating the Impact of Your Project Through Impact Reporting

Impact reporting is essential to demonstrate the impact of a project's outcome on the stakeholders and the organization. Highlighting key performance areas, such as goals and objectives, KPIs and schedule and budget performance, can help showcase the project's value. Metrics should also be used, complemented by appropriate visuals, to present results more tangibly and tie them back to the project's overarching goals.

## Closing a Project: Best Practices for Your Team

Project managers need to conduct retrospectives as part of their project closure process. These retrospectives help teams learn from previous experiences, identify areas for improvement and collaborate better on future projects. Building a blameless culture, celebrating team accomplishments, and staying flexible in the project timeline are essential for effective project closure.

## Understanding the Project Closure Process: A Guide for Project Managers

Proper project closure and documentation are crucial to support knowledge transfer from one team to another for future projects. The project closeout report is a critical document that consists of key components such as the executive summary, list of key accomplishments, lessons learned, open items, next steps, schedule and deadlines, resources and team members, and the project archive. The report evaluates the quality of work and performance of the project, which aids in future planning and execution.
