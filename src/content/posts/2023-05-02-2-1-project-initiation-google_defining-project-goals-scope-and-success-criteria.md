# Chapter 1: What are OKRs and Why Use Them?

## Introduction

As a project manager, you know that setting clear and measurable goals and deliverables is essential for project success. However, you may not be familiar with one of the most popular tools for doing so: Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). In this chapter, we will introduce you to the concept of OKRs, explain how they differ from SMART goals, and show you how they can help you focus your team's efforts on the most impactful activities.

## What are OKRs?

OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results. It is a goal-setting framework that combines a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome. An objective defines what needs to be achieved and describes a desired result or outcome. A key result is a measurable outcome that objectively defines when the objective has been met.

For example, an objective could be to increase customer satisfaction by improving the quality of your product. A key result could be to reduce the number of customer complaints by 50% in the next quarter.

OKRs can be set at different levels, such as company, department, team, or project level. Company-level OKRs are shared across the organization and define the ultimate goal for the entire company. Department or team-level OKRs support the company-level OKRs and focus on the specific results each group needs to achieve. Project-level OKRs define the measurable goals and deliverables for each project.

## How do OKRs differ from SMART goals?

SMART goals are another common tool for setting goals and deliverables. SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. SMART goals are similar to OKRs in that they help establish and clarify goals or objectives for an organization, department, project, or person. However, SMART goals group everything into one statement, while OKRs separate the different components of SMART goals and clarify them even further.

For example, a SMART goal could be to increase customer retention by 10% by the end of the year by offering a new service that provides desk plants to top customers. An OKR for the same goal could be:

- Objective: Increase customer retention by offering a new service
- Key Result 1: Launch Plant Pals service by Q3
- Key Result 2: Enroll 25% of existing customers in Plant Pals pilot by Q4
- Key Result 3: Achieve 90% satisfaction rate among Plant Pals customers by Q4

As you can see, OKRs provide more detail and clarity than SMART goals. They also allow for more flexibility and creativity in defining objectives and key results.

## Why use OKRs for project management?

OKRs can help you improve your project management process in several ways. Here are some of the benefits of using OKRs:

- They help you align your project goals with the organizational goals and vision
- They help you communicate your project goals and expectations to your team and stakeholders
- They help you track and measure your project progress and success
- They help you motivate your team by setting challenging and aspirational objectives
- They help you prioritize your project activities based on their impact

By using OKRs, you can ensure that your project is on track towards achieving its desired outcomes and delivering value to your organization and customers.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we have introduced you to the concept of OKRs and how they differ from SMART goals. We have also shown you how OKRs can help you define and create measurable project goals and deliverables.

# Chapter 2: How to Create Effective OKRs for Your Project

## Introduction

In the previous chapter, we have explained what OKRs are and why they are useful for project management. In this chapter, we will guide you through the steps of creating effective OKRs for your project. We will also share some best practices and tips to help you implement OKRs successfully.

## Steps for Creating OKRs

To create effective OKRs for your project, you need to follow a structured approach. Here are the steps you should take:

### Step 1: Set Your Objectives

Your project objectives should be aspirational, aligned with organizational goals, action-oriented, concrete, and significant. Consider the vision you and your stakeholders have for your project and determine what you want the project team to accomplish in 3-6 months.

To help shape each objective, ask yourself and your team:

- Does the objective help in achieving the project's overall goals?
- Does the objective align with company and departmental OKRs?
- Is the objective inspiring and motivational?
- Will achieving the objective make a significant impact?

Examples of project objectives include:

- Build the most secure data security software
- Continuously improve web analytics and conversions
- Provide a top-performing service
- Make a universally-available app
- Increase market reach
- Achieve top sales among competitors in the region

### Step 2: Develop Key Results

Next, add 2-3 key results for each objective. Key results should be time-bound and can indicate the amount of progress to achieve within a shorter period or define whether you've met your objective at the end of the project. They should also challenge you and your team to stretch yourselves to achieve more.

To help shape your key results, ask yourself and your team:

- What does success mean?
- What metrics would prove that we've successfully achieved the objective?

Examples of key results include:

- X% new signups within the first quarter post-launch
- Increase advertiser spend by X%
- New feature adoption is at least X%
- Maximum 2 critical bugs are reported by customers per Sprint
- Maintain newsletter unsubscribe rate at X%

### Step 3: Document and Communicate Your OKRs

Once you have defined your objectives and key results, document them in a clear and concise format. You can use a spreadsheet, a document, or a dedicated OKR software tool. Make sure to link your OKRs to your project plan and other relevant documents.

Next, communicate your OKRs to your team and stakeholders. Explain the rationale behind each objective and key result and how they align with the organizational goals. Solicit feedback and input from your team and stakeholders to ensure buy-in and commitment.

### Step 4: Track and Review Your OKRs

Finally, track and review your OKRs regularly throughout the project lifecycle. Use the metrics you have defined to measure progress and performance. Identify any gaps or issues that may prevent you from achieving your objectives or key results. Adjust your plans and actions accordingly.

At the end of each project phase or quarter, review your OKRs with your team and stakeholders. Celebrate your achievements and recognize your team's efforts. Analyze what worked well and what didn't. Learn from your successes and failures and apply them to future projects.

## Best Practices for Creating OKRs

Here are some best practices to keep in mind when creating OKRs:

- Think of your objectives as being motivational and inspiring, and your key results as being tactical and specific.
- As a general rule, try to develop around 2-3 key results for each objective.
- Avoid setting too many or too few objectives or key results. Too many can lead to confusion and lack of focus, while too few can lead to complacency and lack of challenge.
- Use simple and clear language that everyone can understand.
- Involve your team and stakeholders in creating OKRs to ensure alignment and engagement.
- Review and update your OKRs as needed to reflect changing circumstances or priorities.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we have guided you through the steps of creating effective OKRs for your project. We have also shared some best practices and tips to help you implement OKRs successfully. By using OKRs, you can ensure that your project is on track towards achieving its desired outcomes and delivering value to your organization and customers.

# Chapter 1: What is Project Scope and Why is it Important?

Project scope is one of the most essential concepts in project management. It defines the boundaries and expectations of a project, and it helps ensure that the project is delivered on time, on budget, and with the desired quality. In this chapter, we will explore what project scope is, why it is important, and how to define it.

## What is Project Scope?

Project scope refers to the work that needs to be done to achieve the project's goals. It includes everything that is in and out of the project, such as the resources, tasks, deliverables, timeline, and budget. Project scope also describes the features and functions of the product or service that the project aims to deliver.

## Why is Project Scope Important?

Project scope is important for several reasons. First, it helps align the expectations and needs of the project stakeholders, such as the sponsors, customers, and team members. By defining what is included and excluded from the project, project scope helps avoid misunderstandings and conflicts.

Second, it helps guide the project planning and execution. By outlining the project requirements and deliverables, project scope helps determine the project schedule, budget, and resources. It also helps measure the project progress and performance.

Third, it helps prevent scope creep. Scope creep refers to the tendency of a project to expand beyond its original scope due to changes or additions that are not planned or approved. Scope creep can cause delays, cost overruns, and quality issues. By establishing a clear and agreed-upon project scope, project managers can control scope creep and ensure project success.

## How to Define Project Scope?

Defining project scope requires a clear understanding of the project's goals and objectives. To define project scope, project managers need to:

- Communicate with stakeholders and determine their expectations, needs, and requirements for the project.
- Document these requirements in a scope statement that describes what is in and out of the project.
- Break down the scope statement into smaller and manageable units called work breakdown structure (WBS), which lists all the tasks and deliverables required to complete the project.
- Validate the scope statement and WBS with stakeholders and get their approval.

## Conclusion

Project scope is a critical aspect of project management that defines the boundaries and expectations of a project. It helps align stakeholder expectations, guide project planning and execution, and prevent scope creep. To define project scope, project managers need to communicate with stakeholders, document their requirements, break down the work into smaller units, and validate and approve the scope with stakeholders.

# Chapter 2: How to Manage Project Scope and Avoid Scope Creep

Managing project scope is a key skill for project managers. It involves ensuring that the project stays within the agreed scope and does not deviate from the original plan. However, managing project scope can be challenging, especially when unexpected changes or requests arise. In this chapter, we will discuss how to manage project scope and avoid scope creep.

## How to Manage Project Scope?

Managing project scope requires constant monitoring and communication. Project managers need to:

- Track and measure the project progress and performance against the scope statement and WBS.
- Identify and document any changes or issues that may affect the project scope, such as new requirements, risks, or assumptions.
- Evaluate the impact of these changes or issues on the project's time, cost, and quality.
- Communicate these changes or issues to stakeholders and get their feedback and approval.
- Update the scope statement and WBS accordingly and ensure that everyone is aware of the changes.

## How to Avoid Scope Creep?

Scope creep is a common problem that can jeopardize a project's success. It occurs when the project scope expands beyond its original boundaries without proper planning or approval. To avoid scope creep, project managers need to:

- Set clear and realistic expectations and boundaries for the project from the start and get stakeholder agreement.
- Document everything related to the project scope, such as the requirements, deliverables, assumptions, exclusions, and constraints.
- Establish a change control process that defines how to handle any changes to the project scope, such as who can request, approve, or reject changes, and how to document and communicate them.
- Learn how to say no to unreasonable or unnecessary requests that are out of scope or do not align with the project's goals.
- Use the triple constraint model to evaluate trade-offs and prioritize the most critical elements of the project.

## What is the Triple Constraint Model?

The triple constraint model is a framework that helps project managers balance three key elements of any project: time, cost, and scope. These three elements are interrelated, and any change in one element affects the other two. For example, if you increase the scope of the project, you may need more time and money to complete it.

The triple constraint model helps project managers make informed decisions about whether to accept or reject a change request, or modify one or more elements of the project. It also helps project managers communicate the impact of changes to stakeholders and negotiate trade-offs.

## Conclusion

Managing project scope is essential to ensure that a project is delivered on time, on budget, and with the desired quality. Project managers need to monitor and control the project scope throughout the project life cycle and avoid scope creep. To do so, they need to communicate with stakeholders, document their requirements, track their progress, evaluate their impact, update their plans, and use the triple constraint model. By following these best practices, project managers can ensure project success.

 # # The Importance of Knowing When Your Project Has Landed

As a project manager, it's essential to understand that project success goes beyond setting SMART goals and managing scope. A critical part of project management is knowing when the project has landed effectively. This article discusses the significance of project landing and defining success criteria to guide the process.

## Defining Project Success

To ensure the success of your project, it's important to test the final outcome based on success criteria established at the beginning of the project. Defining project success goes beyond delivering the final outcome to the client, but also testing if the project has achieved the desired goals.

## The Importance of Landing

Landing is an essential part of the goal-setting process that is often overlooked during project initiation. The success of a project must extend beyond the point of delivering the final project.

## Measuring Project Success

Launching a project does not necessarily imply that the project has landed effectively. For most projects, launching the project is not enough to measure success. Successful landing comes after a launch, requiring the verification of the project's success criteria.

## Defining Success Criteria

To ensure a smooth landing process, project managers must define success criteria. Success criteria establishes standards for judging a project's success and provides guidance on whether you have met your project's goals.

## Communicating Project Success

It's crucial to communicate project success to stakeholders effectively. Defining success criteria provides a clear understanding of when the project has landed successfully and what stakeholders can expect from the project.

# Launching vs Landing a Project: Ensuring Successful Completion

Project managers must understand that achieving a successful landing is critical for project success. Launching a project is just the first step towards project completion. However, landing a project means achieving the project's intended goals, ensuring that all project requirements and goals are met, and delivering satisfactory results to stakeholders and customers.

## Launching a Project

Launching a project involves delivering the final project outcome to the client or users. However, successful project completion goes beyond client acceptance to ensure that the project meets set success criteria.

## Landing a Project

Landing a project occurs when a project achieves its intended goals. To ensure successful landing, project teams must align their efforts toward measurable goals such as increasing retention or speeding up a feature.

## Launch First, Land Later

Project managers must consistently check if their project has landed successfully. Otherwise, they risk only launching a project without securing its intended goals.

## Key Takeaway

To ensure project success, launching the project is just the first step, while a successful landing implies achieving the intended goals of the project. To achieve successful completion, project managers must differentiate between launching and landing and align their teams' efforts toward measurable goals.

# Defining Success Criteria for Your Projects

Defining success criteria is crucial for project managers to prioritize efforts and improve alignment within their teams. It helps determine project accomplishments, and metrics track the established goals. This article explores how to define success criteria and ensure team alignment towards shared goals.

## Setting Up for Success

Establishing goals and deliverables at the beginning of a project sets a framework to determine project accomplishment. Additionally, project managers must define success criteria, which helps clarify goals beyond project launch.

## Defining Success Criteria

Success criteria include the quality of a product, meeting customer and stakeholder expectations, and fulfilling expectations set by an organization's strategic goals.

## Measuring Success

Measuring a project's success involves tracking specific metrics aligned with the project's goals. Metrics can focus on business-oriented metrics, adoption metrics, or engagement metrics.

## Ensuring Alignment and Success

Success documentation and alignment on success criteria are vital for successful project completion. Project managers should periodically communicate and align success criteria with team members and stakeholders.
