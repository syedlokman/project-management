# Chapter 1: Introduction to Agile and Scrum

In this chapter, we will introduce the basics of Agile and Scrum, two popular project management methodologies that can help teams deliver quality products faster and more efficiently. We will also explore how to apply these methods in your daily life and work scenarios.

## What is Agile?

Agile is a framework that embraces change and encourages incremental delivery. Unlike traditional methods that deliver everything at once at the end of the project, Agile allows for the delivery of small bits of value over time. This approach ensures that customers receive value sooner and allows for continuous improvement.

Agile is based on four core values:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

Agile also follows 12 principles that guide the team's behavior and actions. Some of these principles are:

- Delivering valuable software frequently
- Welcoming changing requirements
- Working together daily
- Building projects around motivated individuals
- Maintaining a constant pace
- Reflecting and adjusting regularly

## What is Scrum?

Scrum is one of the most widely used Agile methods. It is a lightweight framework that helps teams work together to deliver complex products. Scrum consists of three roles, five events, and three artifacts.

The three roles are:

- Product Owner: The person who represents the customer and defines the product vision and requirements.
- Scrum Master: The person who facilitates the Scrum process and helps the team follow the Scrum values and principles.
- Development Team: The group of people who do the work of creating the product.

The five events are:

- Sprint: A fixed time-box (usually 2-4 weeks) during which the team delivers a potentially releasable product increment.
- Sprint Planning: A meeting at the beginning of each Sprint where the team decides what to work on and how to do it.
- Daily Scrum: A short (15 minutes) daily meeting where the team members update each other on their progress, plans, and impediments.
- Sprint Review: A meeting at the end of each Sprint where the team demonstrates the product increment to the Product Owner and other stakeholders and collects feedback.
- Sprint Retrospective: A meeting after the Sprint Review where the team reflects on what went well, what can be improved, and what actions to take.

The three artifacts are:

- Product Backlog: A prioritized list of features and requirements for the product, maintained by the Product Owner.
- Sprint Backlog: A subset of items from the Product Backlog that the team commits to deliver in a Sprint, along with a plan for how to do it.
- Product Increment: The sum of all the product backlog items completed during a Sprint and all previous Sprints.

## How to Apply Agile and Scrum in Your Daily Life

Agile and Scrum are not only useful for software development projects. You can also apply them in your daily life and work scenarios. Here are some examples of how you can use Agile thinking and methods in different situations:

- Job interviews: You can prepare for job interviews by creating a backlog of possible questions and answers, prioritizing them based on their importance and difficulty, and practicing them in short sprints. You can also review your performance after each practice session and identify areas for improvement.
- Work scenarios: You can use Scrum to manage your work tasks by creating a backlog of your assignments, prioritizing them based on their value and urgency, and completing them in short sprints. You can also communicate with your colleagues daily, share your progress and challenges, and seek feedback regularly.
- Personal goals: You can use Agile to achieve your personal goals by defining a clear vision of what you want to accomplish, breaking it down into smaller tasks, delivering value incrementally, and adapting to changing circumstances.

# Chapter 2: Agile and Project Management

In this chapter, we will discuss how Agile applies to broader project management disciplines and how it can enhance project management approaches and help teams achieve their goals. We will also provide you with some tips on how to use Agile in your next position.

## What is Project Management?

Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements. Project management involves initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing a project. Project management also requires managing the triple constraint of scope, time, and cost, as well as other aspects such as quality, risk, communication, and stakeholders.

## How Does Agile Fit into Project Management?

Agile is not a project management methodology, but rather a framework that can complement and enhance project management practices. Agile can help project managers and teams to:

- Deliver value faster and more frequently
- Adapt to changing requirements and customer needs
- Collaborate and communicate effectively
- Improve quality and reduce waste
- Increase customer satisfaction and trust
- Empower team members and foster innovation

## How to Use Agile in Your Next Position

If you are interested in using Agile in your next position, here are some tips to help you get started:

- Learn the basics of Agile and Scrum. You can take online courses, read books and blogs, watch videos, or join communities of practice.
- Assess the current state of your organization or project. Identify the pain points, challenges, opportunities, and goals that Agile can help address.
- Choose an Agile approach that suits your context. There are many variations of Agile methods, such as Scrum, Kanban, XP, Lean, etc. You can also mix and match elements from different methods to create your own hybrid approach.
- Start small and experiment. You don't have to adopt Agile all at once. You can start with one team or one project and try out some Agile practices, such as daily stand-ups, retrospectives, or user stories. Learn from your experience and adjust as needed.
- Seek feedback and support. You can ask for feedback from your customers, stakeholders, team members, and peers. You can also seek support from mentors, coaches, or consultants who have experience with Agile.

## Conclusion

Agile is a powerful framework that can help project managers and teams deliver value faster and more efficiently. By understanding the basics of Agile and Scrum, assessing your situation, choosing an appropriate approach, starting small and experimenting, and seeking feedback and support, you can use Agile in your next position and achieve your project goals.

# How to Introduce Agile Practices as a Project Manager

As a project manager, you need to be familiar with different project management methodologies and practices, including Agile. Agile is a flexible and iterative approach that focuses on delivering value to customers and stakeholders. In this chapter, we will discuss how to introduce Agile practices in your organization and how to handle organizational change.

## Understanding Organizational Culture and Change Management

Before you can introduce Agile practices, you need to understand the organizational culture and change management process. Organizational culture is the set of shared values, behaviors, communication styles, and work approaches that define how an organization operates. Change management is the process of getting people to adopt new values, products, or processes.

Introducing Agile practices requires a shift in both culture and management. You need to align the organization's vision and goals with the Agile values and principles. You also need to prepare the people for the change by addressing their concerns and expectations.

Some of the benefits of adopting Agile practices include:

- Faster delivery of working solutions
- Higher customer satisfaction and feedback
- Improved collaboration and communication
- Increased adaptability and innovation
- Enhanced quality and performance

Some of the challenges of adopting Agile practices include:

- Resistance to change and uncertainty
- Lack of trust and support
- Conflicting priorities and expectations
- Inadequate skills and resources
- Misalignment of goals and metrics

As a project manager, you may not be expected to lead a complete change to Agile in a large organization, but you may be expected to help support the change process. On the other hand, you may get hired by a smaller organization that requires you to lead the change process.

## Bringing Agile to the Team

If you are facing a change in organizational culture, it may take some time for the adoption of Agile practices to complete. However, as a project manager, you can implement some changes and add value by demonstrating new and different ways of approaching your projects. Persistence is key in introducing change, and small changes can lead to big results.

Some of the steps you can take to bring Agile to your team are:

- Creating a sense of ownership and urgency: Find an executive sponsor who can support your initiative and communicate the benefits of Agile to the organization. Highlight the opportunities and challenges that your team faces and how Agile can help address them.
- Conducting frequent demos: Show your team and stakeholders the working solutions that you deliver regularly. Solicit feedback and incorporate it into your next iteration. This helps build trust and transparency between your team and your customers.
- Defining clear goals and expectations: Make sure that your team understands what they are expected to deliver, how they will be measured, and when they will be done. Use SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals to guide your team's work.
- Focusing on value delivery: Prioritize your work based on the value it provides to your customers and stakeholders. Use tools like user stories, story maps, or value stream maps to identify the most important features or functions. Deliver them in small batches or increments.

# The Power of Influence in Facilitating Organizational Change

In the previous chapter, we discussed how to introduce Agile practices as a project manager. We covered how to understand organizational culture and change management, and how to bring Agile to your team. In this chapter, we will discuss how to use the influencer change framework to facilitate organizational change.

The influencer change framework is a method that helps you lead and inspire others to change their minds, hearts, and behaviors. It is based on three keys to influence: clarifying measurable results, finding vital behaviors, and leveraging six sources of influence.

## Clarify Measurable Results

Before you can influence others to change, you need to know what you want, why you want it, and when you want it. Effective goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. They help you focus your efforts and track your progress.

When setting goals for your project, make sure to clarify the "why" behind the change. What are the benefits of adopting Agile practices for your team and your organization? How will you measure success? What are the potential risks or challenges?

Make sure that your goals are visible and transparent to your team and stakeholders throughout the change process. This helps build alignment and accountability among everyone involved.

## Find Vital Behaviors

A vital behavior is a small action that an individual takes at a critical moment that contributes to the change they want to create. To effect real change, you need to understand and change the behaviors of others.

To find vital behaviors, you need to analyze the current situation and identify the gaps between the desired and actual outcomes. You also need to consult experts, research best practices, or conduct surveys or interviews to gather data.

Once you have identified the vital behaviors, you need to communicate them clearly and consistently to your team and stakeholders. You also need to model them yourself and provide feedback and recognition to those who exhibit them.

## Use the Six Sources of Influence

The six sources of influence are factors that affect how people think and act. They are based on research that shows that successful change leaders use multiple sources of influence to create lasting change.

The six sources of influence are:

- Personal motivation: This is about making people love what they hate or hate what they love. You can use this source by appealing to people's values, emotions, or interests.
- Personal ability: This is about helping people do what they can't or don't know how to do. You can use this source by providing training, coaching, or mentoring.
- Social motivation: This is about using peer pressure or social support to influence people. You can use this source by creating a positive culture, forming teams or groups, or using role models.
- Social ability: This is about providing people with access to resources or assistance from others. You can use this source by facilitating collaboration, sharing information, or offering help.
- Structural motivation: This is about using rewards or punishments to motivate people. You can use this source by aligning incentives, celebrating successes, or addressing consequences.
- Structural ability: This is about changing the environment or the tools that people use. You can use this source by removing barriers, providing tools or equipment, or simplifying processes.

By using all six sources of influence in combination, you can increase your chances of creating meaningful and sustainable changes in your organization.

## Conclusion

To facilitate organizational change as a project manager, you need to use the influencer change framework. This method helps you clarify measurable results, find vital behaviors, and leverage six sources of influence. By applying these techniques, you can lead and inspire others to adopt Agile practices and improve their performance. For more information on the influencer change framework, we recommend reading the book INFLUENCER: The New Science of Leading Change by Joseph Grenny et al.
