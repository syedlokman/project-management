# Chapter 1: How to Prepare for Negotiations with Stakeholders

As a project manager, you need to be able to negotiate with stakeholders on various aspects of the project, such as scope, timeline, budget, and success criteria. Negotiating with stakeholders can be challenging, but it can also be rewarding if you can achieve a mutually beneficial agreement that meets everyone's needs and expectations. In this chapter, we will cover some tips and best practices on how to prepare for negotiations with stakeholders.

## Filling in Your Project Charter

Before you start negotiating with stakeholders, you need to have a clear and concise summary of your project goals, scope, timeline, and budget. This summary is called a project charter, and it serves as a reference point for all stakeholders throughout the project. A project charter helps you keep everyone aligned and focused on the same objectives.

To fill in your project charter, you need to answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose or need for the project?
- What are the specific deliverables or outcomes of the project?
- What are the key milestones and deadlines of the project?
- What are the estimated costs and benefits of the project?
- Who are the main stakeholders and what are their roles and responsibilities?

## Understanding Your Stakeholders

Your stakeholders are anyone who has a vested interest in the project's success or failure. They may include your clients, sponsors, team members, senior management, end-users, suppliers, regulators, and more. As a project manager, you need to identify and understand your stakeholders' needs, interests, expectations, and concerns.

One way to do this is by conducting a stakeholder analysis. A stakeholder analysis is a process of identifying and prioritizing your stakeholders based on their level of power and interest in the project. You can use a power-interest grid to categorize your stakeholders into four groups:

- High power, high interest: These are your key players who have the most influence and interest in the project. You need to manage them closely and communicate with them frequently.
- High power, low interest: These are your influencers who have the authority but not much interest in the project. You need to keep them satisfied and informed of any major changes or issues.
- Low power, high interest: These are your supporters who have a lot of interest but not much power in the project. You need to keep them engaged and consult with them regularly.
- Low power, low interest: These are your bystanders who have little influence or interest in the project. You need to monitor them and communicate with them occasionally.

By conducting a stakeholder analysis, you can determine which stakeholders you need to prioritize and how best to approach them during negotiations.

## Negotiating with Stakeholders

Once you have filled in your project charter and conducted a stakeholder analysis, you are ready to negotiate with your stakeholders on various aspects of the project. Here are some common topics that you may need to negotiate with your stakeholders:

- Project scope: This is the definition of what the project will deliver and what it will not deliver. You need to negotiate what is realistic and feasible within the given budget and timeline constraints. You also need to manage stakeholder expectations and avoid scope creep or changes that add unnecessary work or complexity to the project.
- Costs and benefits: This is the estimation of how much the project will cost and how much value it will generate. You need to negotiate what benefits are achievable and measurable within the budget limitations. You also need to justify the costs and demonstrate a positive return on investment for the project.
- Success criteria: This is the definition of how success will be measured and evaluated for the project. You need to negotiate what success looks like for each stakeholder group and how it will be verified. You also need to align success criteria with project goals and deliverables.
- Roles and responsibilities: This is the clarification of who will do what on the project team and among other stakeholder groups. You need to negotiate clear roles and responsibilities for each stakeholder group and ensure that they are aligned with their skills and interests. You also need to establish accountability and authority for decision-making and problem-solving on the project.
- Project resources: This is the identification of what resources are needed to complete the project successfully. Resources may include equipment, materials, manpower, funding, time, space, etc. You need to negotiate what resources are available and sufficient for the project scope and quality. You also need to allocate resources efficiently and effectively among different tasks and activities.

## Conclusion

Negotiating with stakeholders is an essential skill for any project manager. By preparing well for negotiations, you can increase your chances of reaching a win-win outcome that satisfies all

# Chapter 2: How to Apply Influence and Constructive Power in Stakeholder Negotiations

As a project manager, you need to be able to influence stakeholders and gain their support for your project. Influence is the ability to persuade others to do something or change their mind without using force or coercion. Influence can help you achieve your project goals, resolve conflicts, and build trust and rapport with your stakeholders.

In this chapter, we will cover some tips and best practices on how to apply influence and constructive power in stakeholder negotiations.

## Establish Credibility

The first step to influencing stakeholders is to establish credibility. Credibility is the perception that you are trustworthy, competent, and reliable. To establish credibility, you need to demonstrate your expertise and experience in the project domain. You also need to show that you understand the stakeholder's perspective and needs. You can do this by:

- Sharing relevant information and data that support your position or proposal
- Providing testimonials or references from previous clients or projects
- Showing empathy and respect for the stakeholder's concerns and emotions
- Admitting your mistakes and limitations and asking for feedback

## Frame for Common Ground

The second step to influencing stakeholders is to frame for common ground. Framing is the way you present your position or proposal in a way that appeals to the stakeholder's interests and values. Framing for common ground means finding areas of agreement or alignment between you and the stakeholder. You can do this by:

- Highlighting the benefits or value of your position or proposal for the stakeholder
- Emphasizing the shared goals or vision of the project
- Acknowledging the risks or challenges of your position or proposal and how they can be mitigated or overcome
- Using positive and inclusive language that fosters collaboration and cooperation

## Provide Evidence

The third step to influencing stakeholders is to provide evidence. Evidence is the facts or data that support your position or proposal. Evidence can help you persuade stakeholders by providing logical and rational reasons for your position or proposal. You can do this by:

- Using statistics, graphs, charts, or reports that show the impact or outcome of your position or proposal
- Sharing case studies, stories, or examples that illustrate the success or feasibility of your position or proposal
- Citing credible sources, experts, or authorities that endorse your position or proposal
- Anticipating and addressing potential objections or counterarguments from the stakeholder

## Connect Emotionally

The fourth step to influencing stakeholders is to connect emotionally. Emotion is the feeling or attitude that influences the stakeholder's decision-making process. Emotion can help you influence stakeholders by appealing to their values, beliefs, or desires. You can do this by:

- Using vivid imagery, metaphors, or analogies that evoke emotion in the stakeholder
- Sharing personal stories, anecdotes, or experiences that relate to the stakeholder's situation
- Expressing enthusiasm, passion, or confidence in your position or proposal
- Showing appreciation, recognition, or gratitude for the stakeholder's contribution or support

## Form a Coalition

Another way to influence stakeholders is to form a coalition. A coalition is a temporary alliance or partnership of individuals or groups with a common purpose or goal. When two or more people work together to advocate for an idea, they can exert more influence than if they acted alone.

Forming a coalition with the right group of people is a powerful and effective negotiation technique. An effective coalition includes people with the right mix of influence or power and interest in the project outcome. You also want to balance your coalition with people who have a high level of power in your organization to help influence and get things done.

To form a coalition, you need to identify potential allies and reach out to them for support. You can use a stakeholder analysis to help you find suitable candidates for your coalition. When you ask for their support, clearly state the issue you are trying to resolve, explain why it matters to them, and ask them how they can help.

## Conclusion

Influencing stakeholders is a vital skill for any project manager. By applying these tips and best practices, you can increase your chances of reaching a win-win outcome that satisfies all parties involved. Whether you are negotiating project scope, timeline, budget, or success criteria, effective influencing can help you achieve your project goals, resolve conflicts, and build trust and rapport with your stakeholders.
