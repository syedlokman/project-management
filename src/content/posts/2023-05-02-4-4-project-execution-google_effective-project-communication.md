Email has been the primary method of business communication for many years. However, messages are often misunderstood or ignored. In this article, we discuss four principles of effective email writing that will help your emails stand out and elicit the desired response.

## State What You Want Clearly

Clear communication requires knowing what you want, when you need it, and the best way to get it. Tips for clearly stating what you want in your email include including the request in the subject line and stating it within the first two paragraphs.

A well-structured email conveys critical information quickly, allowing readers to easily scan the text. Use bullets to break up the text, write strong action verbs at the start of each bullet, and write a strong topic sentence to place the main idea of the paragraph upfront.

## Check Grammar, Punctuation, and Spelling

Be sure to correct any errors before sending off your email. Turn on grammar and spelling suggestions in your email application, read your email out loud, and check for typos and formatting errors.

Team meetings can be a powerful tool for efficiently distributing information, communicating with your team and stakeholders, and keeping a project on track. However, not all meetings are created equal. In this article, we'll look at some tips for organizing and facilitating effective team meetings that can help lead to a successful project.

## Effective Meetings have Common Elements

No matter the size, purpose, or format of a meeting, effective meetings have certain elements in common. They are structured, intentional, collaborative, and inclusive.

### Structured Meetings

Effective meetings are structured. To ensure that everyone's time is used effectively, consider the following:

- Invite only those who can contribute to the discussion or will be directly affected by the topics discussed.
- Prioritize meeting topics with an agenda and give each topic a buffer of a few minutes (timeboxing).
- Make sure you schedule enough time for the topic you need to cover.

### Intentional Meetings

Effective meetings are also intentional. This means they have a clearly stated purpose and expectations.

### Collaborative Meetings

Collaboration is an essential component of effective meetings. Even if the purpose of the meeting is for one person to share important information with the rest of the group, there are ways to make meetings more collaborative.

### Inclusive Meetings

Finally, an effective meeting is an inclusive one.

## Types of Project Meetings

As a project manager, you'll likely be involved in a variety of meetings, each with its unique format and purpose. Some common types of project meetings include:

- Kickoff Meetings
- Daily or Weekly Team Meetings
- Progress Review Meetings
- Design or Strategy Meetings
- Decision-Making Meetings
- Closing Meetings

## How to Make Your Meetings More Inclusive

Creating an inclusive environment can be particularly challenging in meetings. As a project manager, it is part of your job to facilitate meetings that are inclusive of all participants and that create a sense of emotional safety and value for everyone’s active input.

### Formalize Check-Ins

Formalize initial check-ins for the group that build understanding and ensure everyone knows their input is needed.

### Model Professionalism, Vulnerability, and Empathy

As the project manager, your modeling will set the tone for the team dynamic. Popular check-ins include: “A highlight of my week has been . . .” and “This week I have gratitude for . . .” 

### Help All Participants Be Heard

Help all participants to be heard. Solicit ideas from participants, and ask questions to encourage participation. If someone gets interrupted, redirect everyone’s attention to that person and prompt them to finish their thought.

### Encourage Different Perspectives

Help participants feel comfortable sharing different perspectives. Encourage differing or opposing ideas by making clear that alternate viewpoints are valued.

## Best Practices for Productive Meetings

Implementing best practices before, during, and after meetings can help ensure productivity.

### Three Elements of Productive Meetings

Internal studies at Google have shown that productive meetings have three common elements:

1. Active participation from attendees
2. A clear and concise agenda that is followed throughout
3. The correct attendees

### Before the Meeting

Create an agenda and evaluate the need for the meeting.

### During the Meeting

Stick to the agenda, encourage active participation, and capture key points.

### After the Meeting

Recap key decisions and assess recurring meetings.

## Common Types of Project Meetings

There are four general types of project management meetings: project kick-off, status updates, stakeholder reviews, and project reviews.

### Project Kick-off Meeting

The project kick-off meeting is the official beginning of a project and serves as a way to align the team's understanding of the project goals with actual plans and procedures.

### Status Update Meetings

This category includes regular team meetings where the primary goal is to align the team on updates, progress, challenges, and next steps.

### Stakeholder Meetings

Stakeholder engagement is essential for a successful project management. Stakeholder meetings are where these contributions are outlined and utilized.

### Project Reviews

The end of the project or the end of the project phase is an excellent opportunity to review how the project unfolded.

## Conclusion

Knowing the difference between these project meeting types allows you to maximize productivity and ensure that you're not wasting time. Effective meetings help drive decisions and lead to proactive positive actions.
