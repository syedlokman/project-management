# Understanding High-Functioning Teams: A Digest Blog Article

Developing a high-functioning team is vital to achieving project goals. In this blog post, we will explore the benefits of having a high-functioning team and techniques for managing team dynamics and motivating team members to succeed.

## The Value of High-Functioning Teams

High-functioning teams can deliver better results, identify and resolve issues faster, and ensure that projects are completed on time and within budget. The success of any project depends on the capability of its team members. 

## The Different Stages of Team Development

Developing a high-performing team requires time and effort. There are several stages of team development, including forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning. Understanding these stages can help you manage each one effectively and build a cohesive team.

## Managing Team Dynamics

As a project manager, you play a crucial role in managing team dynamics and ensuring that each team member is contributing effectively. It's essential to deal with conflicts early on and address any other issues that might cause problems in the long run. By doing so, you can maintain a positive work environment that encourages productivity and engagement.

## Motivating Project Team Members

Motivating team members can be challenging, but it's essential if you want them to perform at their best. Each person is unique, and what motivates one team member might not necessarily work for another. Therefore, it's essential to provide personalized levels of engagement that cater to each person's specific needs. 

## Techniques for Influencing Others

As a project manager, the ability to persuade others to adopt new processes, resolve conflicts, or accomplish other tasks is essential. It's important to have excellent communication skills that allow you to effectively articulate your ideas and explain the rationale behind them.

# The Importance of Teamwork in Project Management

Successful project management goes beyond just leading a team to complete a project. It's about supporting and enabling the people on your team to do their best work and build something they're proud of. In this blog post, we'll define teamwork, explain why it's important for successful project management, and take you through the elements of effective teams.

## Defining the Term "Team"

A team is a group of people who plan, solve problems, make decisions, and review progress in service of a specific project or objective. Team members rely on each other to get things done.

## Teams vs. Workgroups

While workgroups are also based on a common goal, their work is more likely to be coordinated, controlled, or assigned by a single person or entity. On the other hand, teams work collaboratively and support each other to achieve a shared goal.

## The Importance of Teamwork in Project Management

Teamwork promotes creativity, encourages accountability, and helps you achieve project goals. By leveraging diverse perspectives, skills, and experiences, a team can devise better solutions and build products that address more diverse user needs than they might have when working independently.

## The Elements of Effective Teams

Effective teams comprise members with diverse skills, experiences, and backgrounds. Project managers must identify and leverage each team member's strengths and skills to achieve the project's objectives. Here are some of the essential elements of effective teams:

1. Clear Communication
2. Collaborative Environment
3. Clear Roles and Responsibilities
4. Complementary Skill Sets
5. Trust and Accountability

# Understanding Team Motivators: What Drives Team Effectiveness?

To succeed, teams need to understand their motivators. In this blog post, we will explore the factors that impact team effectiveness and how project managers can lead their teams to reach project goals.

## The Dynamics of Effective Teams

Researchers at Google identified five factors that impact team effectiveness, listed in order of importance:

1. Psychological Safety
2. Dependability
3. Structure and Clarity
4. Meaning
5. Impact

## Psychological Safety: The Number One Factor that Impacts Team Effectiveness

Psychological safety refers to an individual's perception of the consequences of taking interpersonal risks. Creating a culture of psychological safety is the number one factor that impacts team effectiveness.

## Dependability: Reliability is Key

Dependable teams are reliable and complete their work on time. A project manager needs to establish a two-way relationship with their team.

## Structure and Clarity: Understand Your Role in the Team

Every team member should have a clear understanding of their role, plans, goals, and how their work impacts the group.

## Meaning: Finding Purpose in Your Work

It is essential to understand what motivates your team members and help them find a sense of purpose and fulfillment in the work that they do.

## Impact: Believing in the Change You Create

Identifying the impact that their work has on the larger project goals is crucial for team members. 

## How Project Managers can Lead Teams to Reach Project Goals

Project managers must foster a culture of mutual respect and psychological safety, set clear expectations while allowing collaboration and negotiation, help team members find meaning and purpose in their work, and identify the impact their work can have on the larger picture.
 # # Chapter 1: What is Ethical Leadership and Why Does It Matter?

Ethical leadership is a form of leadership that promotes and values honesty, justice, respect, community, and integrity. Ethical leaders act in accordance with ethical principles and standards, and they inspire others to do the same. Ethical leadership is especially important for project managers, who play a crucial role in leading their teams towards success.

## The Benefits of Ethical Leadership

Ethical leadership can bring many benefits to project managers and their teams, such as:

- **Building trust and respect**. Ethical leaders are transparent, consistent, and fair in their actions and decisions. They communicate effectively and listen to feedback. They also acknowledge their mistakes and take responsibility for them. By doing so, they build trust and respect with their team members, external partners, and project stakeholders.
- **Enhancing team performance**. Ethical leaders create a positive and supportive work environment where team members feel valued and empowered. They also foster a culture of collaboration, innovation, and learning. They encourage team members to share their ideas, opinions, and concerns, and they integrate diverse perspectives into project decisions. By doing so, they enhance team performance and project outcomes.
- **Reducing risks**. Ethical leaders are aware of the potential ethical issues and dilemmas that may arise in their projects. They proactively address them by following ethical guidelines and frameworks, consulting with relevant parties, and seeking guidance when needed. They also ensure that their projects comply with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as organizational policies and standards. By doing so, they reduce the risks of ethical violations, conflicts, or reputational damage.

## The Challenges of Ethical Leadership

Ethical leadership can also pose some challenges for project managers, such as:

- **Balancing competing interests**. Project managers often have to deal with multiple stakeholders who may have different or conflicting expectations, goals, or values. They also have to manage various constraints such as time, budget, scope, and quality. Balancing these competing interests can be difficult and may require making trade-offs or compromises that may not satisfy everyone.
- **Navigating ethical dilemmas**. Project managers may face ethical dilemmas where there is no clear or easy solution. For example, they may have to choose between delivering a project on time or ensuring its quality; between following the client's request or adhering to the organization's values; between protecting the team's interests or reporting a misconduct. Navigating these ethical dilemmas can be stressful and complex.
- **Overcoming biases**. Project managers are human beings who are subject to various cognitive biases that may affect their ethical judgment. For example, they may be influenced by self-interest, loyalty, conformity, or rationalization. They may also be unaware of their own biases or blind spots that may prevent them from seeing the ethical implications of their actions.

# Conclusion

Ethical leadership is a vital skill for project managers who want to lead their teams effectively and responsibly. By leading with ethics, project managers can build respect and trust with the people they work with, enhance team performance and project outcomes, and reduce risks of ethical violations or conflicts. However, ethical leadership also comes with some challenges that require careful consideration and reflection. In the next chapter, we will explore some strategies and frameworks that can help project managers practice ethical leadership in their projects.

# Chapter 2: How to Practice Ethical Leadership in Your Projects

Ethical leadership is not only a matter of principle, but also a matter of practice. As a project manager, you need to apply ethical principles and standards to your actions and decisions in your projects. But how can you do that effectively and consistently? In this chapter, we will explore some strategies and frameworks that can help you practice ethical leadership in your projects.

## Strategies for Ethical Leadership

Here are some strategies that can help you practice ethical leadership in your projects:

- **Define and align values**. One of the first steps to practice ethical leadership is to define and align your values with those of your organization, your team, and your project stakeholders. Values are the beliefs and principles that guide your behavior and decisions. By clarifying and communicating your values, you can establish a common ground and a shared vision for your project. You can also use your values as a reference point when you face ethical dilemmas or conflicts.
- **Follow ethical guidelines and frameworks**. Another strategy to practice ethical leadership is to follow ethical guidelines and frameworks that are relevant to your profession, industry, organization, or project. Ethical guidelines and frameworks are sets of rules or principles that provide guidance for ethical decision-making and behavior. For example, the Project Management Institute (PMI) has a Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct that outlines the expectations for project managers in terms of responsibility, respect, fairness, and honesty. By following ethical guidelines and frameworks, you can ensure that your actions and decisions comply with the standards of your field and organization.
- **Consult with others**. A third strategy to practice ethical leadership is to consult with others when you face ethical issues or dilemmas. Consulting with others can help you gain different perspectives, insights, and feedback on your situation. You can consult with your team members, mentors, peers, experts, or other stakeholders who have relevant knowledge or experience. By consulting with others, you can broaden your understanding of the issue, explore alternative options, and make more informed decisions.
- **Seek guidance**. A fourth strategy to practice ethical leadership is to seek guidance when you need it. Seeking guidance can help you resolve ethical issues or dilemmas that are complex, ambiguous, or unfamiliar. You can seek guidance from various sources, such as ethical decision-making frameworks, organizational policies or procedures, professional associations or bodies, or ethics committees or officers. By seeking guidance, you can get support and advice on how to handle the issue ethically and appropriately.

## A Framework for Ethical Decision-Making

One of the frameworks that can help you practice ethical leadership is the framework for ethical decision-making developed by the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University. This framework involves five steps:

- **Recognize an ethical issue**. The first step is to identify the ethical issue or dilemma that you are facing. You can ask yourself questions such as: Could this decision or situation harm someone? Does this issue go beyond legal or policy requirements? What are the values involved in this issue?
- **Get the facts**. The second step is to gather relevant facts and information about the issue or dilemma. You can ask yourself questions such as: What are the facts of the situation? Who are the stakeholders involved? What are their interests and concerns? What are the possible consequences of each option?
- **Evaluate alternative actions**. The third step is to evaluate different options for action based on ethical principles and standards. You can ask yourself questions such as: Which option will produce the most good and do the least harm? Which option respects the rights and dignity of all stakeholders? Which option is fair and just?
- **Make a decision and test it**. The fourth step is to choose an option and test it by imagining how others would react to it. You can ask yourself questions such as: Would I be comfortable if this decision were made public? Would I be proud of this decision? How would this decision affect my reputation or credibility?
- **Act and reflect on the outcome**. The fifth step is to implement your decision with care and consideration. You can also reflect on the outcome of your decision by asking yourself questions such as: Did I achieve my intended goals? Did I encounter any unexpected problems or challenges? How did my decision affect others? What did I learn from this experience?
