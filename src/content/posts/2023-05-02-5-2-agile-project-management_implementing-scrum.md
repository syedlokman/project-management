# Chapter 1: What is Asana and How to Upload Your Spreadsheet

Asana is a web and mobile application that helps teams organize, track, and manage projects. It was founded in 2008 by two former Facebook employees and has over 1.5 million users worldwide. In this chapter, we will introduce you to Asana and show you how to upload your existing spreadsheet to Asana using the CSV importer tool.

## What is Asana?

Asana is a work management tool that reduces wasted time by empowering project managers to focus on project planning, team alignment, and resource allocation. Many organizations use Asana to manage everything from simple projects with small teams to complex projects with multiple stakeholders.

Asana allows you to create projects, tasks, subtasks, and custom fields to capture all the details of your work. You can also assign tasks to team members, set due dates, add comments, attach files, and track progress. Asana also integrates with many other tools and apps, such as Google Drive, Slack, Zoom, and more.

Asana offers different views to help you visualize your work in different ways. For example, you can use the list view to see all your tasks in a simple list, the board view to see your tasks as cards in columns, the timeline view to see your tasks on a Gantt chart, or the calendar view to see your tasks on a calendar.

Asana also provides various features to help you collaborate with your team and stakeholders. For example, you can use the conversations feature to start discussions, share updates, and give feedback. You can also use the status feature to publish weekly status updates and highlight accomplishments, progress, and blockers.

## How to Upload Your Spreadsheet to Asana

If you already have a spreadsheet with your project details, you can easily import it to Asana using the CSV importer tool. A CSV file uses a comma to separate values and holds a spreadsheet's data. The CSV importer tool enables you to move your workflow from a spreadsheet software like Excel or Google Sheets directly to Asana.

To upload your spreadsheet to Asana, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Asana account and create a new project using the blank project template.
2. Click on the project name in the top left corner and select "Add tasks via" from the dropdown menu.
3. Select "CSV" from the options and click on "Choose File" to upload your CSV file.
4. Map your columns to Asana fields by selecting the corresponding field from the dropdown menu for each column. For example, if your spreadsheet has a column named "User Story", you can map it to the "Task Name" field in Asana.
5. Click on "Preview" to see how your data will look in Asana and make any adjustments if needed.
6. Click on "Import" to start importing your data to Asana.

Once your data is imported, you can start adding effort estimates, sorting user stories, and setting due dates in Asana.

In the next chapter, we will show you how to add effort estimates in Asana using fields like Epic, Value, and Estimate. Stay tuned!

# Chapter 2: How to Add Effort Estimates in Asana

With your project uploaded to Asana, adding effort estimates is simple. In this chapter, we will show you how to add effort estimates to your project using fields like Epic, Value, and Estimate.

## What are Fields in Asana?

Fields are a way to add additional information to your tasks in Asana. You can use fields to capture various aspects of your work, such as priority, status, category, or anything else that is relevant to your project.

Asana provides some default fields that you can use for your tasks, such as assignee, due date, tags, and followers. You can also create custom fields to suit your specific needs. Custom fields allow you to define the type of data you want to store, such as text, number, date, or dropdown.

You can add fields to your project by clicking on the "Customize" button in the top right corner of your project and selecting "Fields". You can then choose from the existing fields or create new ones.

## How to Add Effort Estimates Using Fields

To add effort estimates to your project using fields, follow these steps:

1. Create a custom field for Epic by selecting a dropdown field and using Epic as the field name. You can then add the names of your epics as options for this field. For example, you can add Live Plant Delivery, Office Plant Advice Service, Vendor Management, and Client Data Management as options for the Epic field.
2. Create a custom field for Value by selecting a dropdown field and using Value as the field name. You can then add the values that represent the business value of each user story as options for this field. For example, you can use dollar signs ranging from one dollar sign for low value to four dollar signs for high value.
3. Create a custom field for Estimate by selecting a number field and using Estimate as the field name. You can then enter the number of story points that represent the effort required for each user story in this field. For example, you can enter 8 for Low Maintenance Options, 13 for Plant Care Tools, and 8 for Expert Help and Advice.
4. Assign each user story to an epic by selecting the appropriate option from the Epic field dropdown menu.
5. Assign each user story a value by selecting the appropriate option from the Value field dropdown menu.
6. Assign each user story an estimate by entering the number of story points in the Estimate field.

Once you have added effort estimates using fields, you can sort your user stories by any of the fields by clicking on the column header. You can also switch to different views to see your data in different ways. For example, you can use the board view to see your user stories as cards in columns or the timeline view to see your user stories on a Gantt chart.

## Conclusion

Asana provides a powerful platform to manage your projects from start to finish. By adding effort estimates using fields, you can keep track of the complexity and value of each user story and prioritize them accordingly. You can also use different views and integrations to visualize and collaborate on your work more effectively.

We hope this article has helped you learn how to add effort estimates in Asana. If you have any questions or feedback, please let us know in the comments below. Happy estimating!

# Chapter 1: What are Sprints and How to Define Them

In this chapter, we will introduce the concept of Sprints in Scrum and how to define their length and timebox. We will also discuss the importance of timeboxing and how to choose the right Sprint length for your project.

## What are Sprints?

Sprints, also known as iterations, are timeboxed periods during which a Scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. They are a core part of Scrum, and the other four Scrum events all revolve around the Sprint. Each Sprint is like a mini-project with planning, execution, delivery, closing, and a retrospective all wrapped into one.

## Defining Sprints

The length of a Sprint is determined based on the historical capacity of the team and the amount of work planned for the Sprint. Sprints can range anywhere from one to four weeks, depending on three considerations.

### Considerations for defining the length of a Sprint

1. **Frequency of changes:** If the project is expected to have new requests popping up each week, a shorter Sprint length may be a better choice to adapt more often.

2. **Focus time for developers:** If most activities require at least a week to create something valuable, the Sprint length should be at least two weeks to give the team room to execute without feeling crunch mode.

3. **Overhead for delivery:** If the deliverable or solution requires a large review with many stakeholders or goes through rigorous testing and quality assurance processes that take several days, factor those into Sprint length and choose a longer Sprint.

There's no one-size-fits-all answer for Sprint length, but it can always be adjusted after a few Sprints if needed.

## Timeboxing in Scrum

Timeboxes are an important concept in Scrum. They create a sense of urgency that drives prioritization, provide a window of focus that improves productivity, and help the team develop a predictable rhythm to their work. Each of the five Scrum events – Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective – has a recommended timebox.

## How to choose the right Sprint length?

When choosing the length of your Sprint, you should consider how often your requirements might change, how much focus time your solution developers might need, and how much overhead goes into delivering your product.
 # 
Okay, I will try to write the second chapter of the summarized blog article in markdown. Here is what I came up with:

# Chapter 2: How to Conduct Sprint Events

In this chapter, we will explore the relationship between the Sprint and other Scrum events, starting with Sprint Planning and the Sprint Backlog. We will also cover the Daily Scrum, the Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective.

## Sprint Planning

Sprint Planning is the first event within the Sprint that sets the team up for success for the next one to four weeks, depending on the length they have chosen. During Sprint Planning, the entire Scrum team comes together to confirm how much capacity (time and people) is available during the Sprint and identify what items from the backlog will be done during the Sprint.

This process creates the Sprint Backlog, which ultimately becomes the Sprint goal. Throughout the event, the Scrum Master facilitates team communication and answers questions to ensure that everyone is on the same page.

## Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Backlog is a set of product Backlog items that are identified for completion during the upcoming Sprint. For example, if a product backlog has 50 items, the team may select the top five items based on their capacity for the given Sprint. These five items then become the Sprint Backlog.

## Sprint Goal

The Sprint Goal is the overarching objective that the team aims to achieve during the Sprint. This should be taken from a bigger picture view of the items on the Sprint Backlog. The benefit of having a broader Sprint Goal is that it helps the team focus on a common objective rather than being divided into separate work streams.

## Daily Scrum

The Daily Scrum is sometimes referred to as stand up. It is a time for the Scrum Team to synchronize and prioritize activities for the day. In 15 minutes, and at the same time and place every day, each team member answers the following questions:

1. What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint goal?
2. What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint goal?
3. Do I notice any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting our goals?

Daily stand-ups should provide the Scrum Master with the opportunity to quickly unblock the team with little delay. And Daily Stand-ups are an opportunity to reinforce focus on the Sprint Backlog and Sprint Goal.

## Sprint Review

At the closing of a Sprint, the team will complete another event, known as the Sprint Review. This Sprint event is crucial to the Scrum Pillars of inspection and adaptation, and demonstrates the values of openness, courage, and respect.

The Sprint Review is a meeting with the entire Scrum Team where the product is demonstrated in order to determine which aspects are finished and which aren't. The Development Team and Product Owner will play a heavy role in this inspection and discussion. They will also cover an exploration of which items should be considered done in the Product Backlog, and they'll demonstrate and inspect the product.

Sprint Reviews should be really fun and uplifting. The Sprint Review is when the team gets to impress each other with the cool things they've accomplished over
the last 1 to 4 weeks. These time-boxed meetings should not exceed four hours, and they're a good opportunity for
the team to practice
the Scrum Values of openness and respect,
as they give feedback about
the completed work.

## Sprint Retrospective

The final event within
the Sprint is
the Sprint Retrospective.
This is a meeting where
the team reflects on
their performance and identifies areas for improvement.
The Scrum Master leads
this meeting and ensures that
the team stays positive and constructive.
The team discusses what went well,
what didn't go well,
and what actions they can take
to improve in
the next Sprint.
The outcome of
the retrospective is
a list of actionable items that
the team commits to implementing in
the next Sprint.

## Conclusion

In this chapter,
we learned about
the different events that take place within
a Sprint in Scrum.
We covered how
to plan,
execute,
review,
and improve
our work as
a Scrum Team.
By following these events,
we can ensure that
we deliver value to
our customers and stakeholders,
and continuously improve our processes and products.

 # # Summary: Understanding Burndown Charts, Velocity, Kanban Boards and Essential Tools in Scrum

As Scrum Project Management gains more popularity in the industry, it is crucial to understand vital concepts such as Burndown Charts, Velocity, Kanban boards, and Essential Tools in Scrum. Each of these concepts plays a critical role in achieving successful project management, transparency and collaboration within the team. 

## Understanding Burndown Charts and Velocity in Scrum

Burndown charts help measure time against the amount of work done and the remaining workload during a Sprint. It enables teams to stay aware of their progress towards their goals. Velocity, on the other hand, is the number of story points a team can do during a sprint. It's a unit of measurement in Scrum that signifies how much work a team can realistically accomplish in a given timeframe.

## The Importance of Kanban Boards for Scrum Teams

Kanban boards offer enhanced visualization of progress, increased focus on critical tasks, and a better understanding of the flow of work through the team's execution processes. The physical or virtual representation of the Kanban board allows teams to see how work moves through the various stages of the Scrum process, making their execution work efficient.

## The Essential Tools in Scrum

Tools play an essential role in ensuring successful Scrum project management. There are Scrum-specific tools for managing backlogs and sprints, such as Jira, Trello, and Asana, which allow efficient planning and coordination of work. Documentation and collaboration tools such as Google Docs, Microsoft Excel, and video conferencing and online chats enable team members to communicate effectively, get quick answers and stay proactive. 

## Conclusion

Scrum teams can leverage key concepts and tools such as Burndown charts, Velocity, Kanban boards, and Essential Tools in Scrum to improve efficiency, predictability and collaboration while achieving their goals. Each of these concepts and tools has a unique role in ensuring successful Scrum project management, transparency, and communication within the team.
 # # Agile and Scrum: A Recap

In this blog article, we will recap some of the key terms and concepts covered in the Agile and Scrum course. We will also share a helpful YouTube video, *Agile Product Ownership in a Nutshell*, that provides further insight into these methodologies.

## What is Agile?

Agile is a methodology that focuses on the iterative and incremental development of a product or service. The approach emphasizes teamwork, collaboration, flexibility, and iterative feedback to deliver a high-quality product that meets the needs of the users.

## What is Scrum?

Scrum is an Agile framework that provides a structured approach to project management. The framework is built around short iterations, or sprints, which typically last between one to four weeks. During each sprint, a specific set of tasks is completed, and the team comes together for daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress and identify any roadblocks.

## Agile and Scrum Key Terms

### User stories

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature or functionality that a user wants. They are written from the perspective of the user and describe the need, the benefit, and the desired outcome.

### Sprint planning

Sprint planning is the process of defining the goals and objectives for a sprint. During this process, the team determines what work needs to be done, how it will be accomplished, and who will be responsible for each task.

### Product backlog

The product backlog is a prioritized list of features or functionality that needs to be developed. The product owner is responsible for maintaining the product backlog, which is continually reviewed and updated throughout the project.

### Scrum master

The Scrum master is responsible for ensuring that the Scrum process is followed and that the team has the resources and support they need to complete the project successfully.

### Sprint review

The sprint review is a meeting held at the end of each sprint. During the meeting, the team demonstrates the work that was completed during the sprint and receives feedback from stakeholders.

### Sprint retrospective

The sprint retrospective is a meeting held at the end of each sprint to reflect on what went well, what didn't go well, and identify opportunities for improvement.

## Congratulations on Finishing Another Set of Videos!

During the Agile and Scrum course, the importance of the Product Backlog was emphasized. We learned about refining the Product Backlog and the significance of relative effort estimation using methods such as T-shirt sizing and story points.

We also covered the five key Scrum events, which are the Sprint itself, Sprint Planning, the Daily Scrum, the Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective. Each of these events has a different purpose and takes place at different times throughout the Sprint.

Throughout the course, we explored visual learning using tools such as burndown charts and Kanban boards. These tools allow us to get a deeper understanding of our team's work and identify any inefficiencies or challenges that need to be addressed.

We also looked at tools like Jira, Asana, and Trello, which make it easy to keep our workflow transparent and keep every team member up-to-date with the progress made throughout the Sprint.

## Next Steps

Congratulations on completing another set of videos and making it this far in your Scrum and Agile journey. The next step is to learn how to use Agile and Scrum to adapt in real-life situations.

We hope you enjoyed this course and that you find success in all your future Scrum and Agile endeavors. Good luck!
