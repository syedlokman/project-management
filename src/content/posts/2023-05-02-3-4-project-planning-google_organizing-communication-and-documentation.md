# Planning 101: Tying Together Key Components

Planning plays a crucial role in project management. To become a pro at project planning, it is essential to tie together all the key components, such as setting a schedule, creating and managing a budget, identifying and managing risks, and communication planning.

## The Importance of Communication Plans

Effective communication is necessary for successful project management. Developing a successful communication plan enables team members to work together efficiently, understand expectations clearly, and improve collaboration.

## Effective Communication Strategies

There are many ways to communicate during the planning phase and beyond. Some great communication strategies include establishing routine communication, determining the right level of detail, using project management software, encouraging face-to-face communication, providing regular feedback, and encouraging collaborative communication.

## Creating a Communication Plan

To create an effective communication plan, it is necessary to follow specific key steps, such as defining communication objectives, identifying stakeholders, determining the right communication channels, defining your message, developing a communication schedule, and assigning communication responsibilities.

## The Importance of Communication in Project Management

Communication is fundamental to project management. Clear and frequent communication enables project teams to understand what is happening, and team members can see how their tasks contribute to the project's goals. Poor communication can result in misunderstandings, missed deadlines, and even project failure.

### Examples of Poor Communication

Two examples of poor communication include planning a surprise party and working on a project with under-committed design specialists. In both cases, poor communication led to confusion, missed opportunities, and delayed projects.

## Steps to Creating a Communication Plan

To create an effective communication plan, you should identify stakeholders, determine communication needs, define communication goals, choose communication methods, state the purpose of your communication, and document everything.

## Benefits of a Communication Plan

A communication plan organizes different types of communication for a project, ensures everyone is aware of what information needs to be communicated and how and promotes effective change management. It also provides a useful tool for future projects.

## Tips for an Effective Communication Plan

When creating a communication plan, it is important to identify project stakeholders, choose the right frequency and delivery method, list key dates, and document your plan. You should also test your plan, check-in with your audience, and evaluate where
 # # The Importance of Documentation in Project Management

Documentation is a crucial aspect of project management that is often overlooked. In this blog post, we discuss the importance of documentation in project management and how it can streamline communication among team members.

## Centralizing Your Documents

Storing and sharing plans in a centralized place is essential to maintain clarity across teams. It reduces duplicate work and streamlines communication, making it easier for team members to find the information they need without wasting time.

## Organizing Plans for Communication

Organizing documents stored in separate folders or labeled appropriately makes communication and retrieval more straightforward. This organization helps optimize workflow and reduce confusion among team members.

## Visibility and Accountability

Documenting project plans ensures proper communication, accountability, and visibility across the team. It provides a record for post-project reviews, making knowledge management easier.

## Managing Permissions

Managing file permissions ensures that sensitive data is not made available and enables a team to share information that is essential. Summarizing the relevant information in a status report for individuals who don't need detailed background knowledge ensures everyone stays informed about the project's progress.

## Continuity

Proper documentation ensures that the project can carry on without the project manager. With careful documentation and management of files, new staff members can quickly take over in case of the absence of the project manager.

## Sharing Information the Right Way

Determine the appropriate information to share with individuals and when to share it. Focus on sharing information related to what specific individuals need to know. Sharing too much information can have unintended consequences.

## Sensitivity of Information

Some project documents are particularly sensitive and should only be shared with specific team members with the necessary permissions. Sharing classified information on a need-to-know basis prevents accidental leaks that can harm the project's progress.

# How to Organize Your Project Plans

Organizing project plans has several benefits, including easy access, improved collaboration, and reduced confusion among team members. In this section, we explore how to use tools like Google Drive and spreadsheets to organize and share information with your team.

## Using a Centralized Location

Create a new folder labeled with the name of your project and use it to store all your project files. Create sub-folders within the main project folder to store relevant files. Create a centralized planning document that links all the files and resources that your project uses.

## Using a Spreadsheet

Create a new sheet labeled with the name of your project and group all project-related spreadsheets within this sheet. Include an overview sheet, which serves as the dashboard of your project plan. Provide a brief description of the project and instructions for using the sheet. Link all files and resources to the centralized planning document or dashboard sheet.

# The Importance of Keeping Artifacts in Diversity Programming

In this section, we explore the importance of keeping artifacts in diversity programming, as shared by Chris, a diversity program manager at Google.

## Focus on Underrepresented Groups

Chris focuses on diversity programming for the most underrepresented groups at Google.

## Importance of Organizing Materials

Chris emphasizes the importance of organizing materials when thinking about who needs to be involved in the projects and who will invest in the programs that he wants to roll out.

## Definition of Artifacts

Chris defines artifacts as anything that physically describes or showcases the work being done, such as documents or roles and responsibilities sheets.

## Benefits of Keeping Artifacts

Chris highlights the importance of keeping artifacts organized and up-to-date not just for his own use but also for stakeholders, teammates, and vendors. This allows for the best possible outcome in program management elements and making the program successful.

## Showcasing Work at the End

Chris emphasizes the importance of showcasing work at the end to understand where he started and how far he has come. This also helps when it comes to possibly getting more budget for a program or taking the program to the next level.

## Importance of Being Able to Speak to Artifacts

Chris suggests that being able to speak to artifacts allowed him to showcase how and what he did to make the program or project successful. During job interviews, the artifacts physically show his ability to conduct the entire process from start to finish.

In conclusion, proper documentation, centralization, and organization of project plans and artifacts are essential for efficient project management. By using tools like Google Drive and spreadsheets and carefully managing file permissions, the team can work together towards achieving project goals. In diversity programming, keeping artifacts organized and up-to-date can make the program successful and allow for showcasing skills.
 # # The Importance of a Strong Resume in Your Job Search

Job searching can be overwhelming, whether it's your first or tenth time. A well-crafted resume is essential throughout your job search, regardless of your level of experience or career goals. Your resume is typically the initial impression that recruiters have of you, making it crucial to pay careful attention to the information you include on it. Here are some tips for creating a strong resume.

## Contact Information and Objective Summary

Your name, email address, and any relevant phone numbers or addresses should be included in your contact information. Some job seekers opt to include a brief objective summary at the start of their resume. This isn't mandatory, but it can be beneficial in emphasizing your career goals and relevant experience.

## Work and Educational Experience

The core of a resume is your work and educational experience. When listing your work experience, you should provide information on your previous employers, job titles, start and end dates, and a brief summary of your primary responsibilities and accomplishments. For your educational experience, you should include your degrees, certifications, and any other professional development that may be relevant to your desired position.

## Highlighting Your Skills

You must highlight your relevant skills to create a strong resume. This may include technical skills, industry specific knowledge, or soft skills like communication and problem-solving. Listing the details of your skills and experience can be essential in catching a recruiter's eye.

## Adding Additional Information

Personal hobbies, volunteer work, or other experiences can showcase your personality and make you stand out to potential employers. Fluency in another language or hobbies that require skills relevant to the job can help bolster your resume.

## Utilizing LinkedIn

In today's digital age, LinkedIn can be an essential tool for job seekers. By creating a strong LinkedIn profile, you can increase your visibility to recruiters and hiring managers and provide additional information about your skills and experience.

Create one master project management resume that you can edit and tailor to each job application. Ordering the resume to reflect the job description, prioritizing the skills and qualifications most important to the employer, is critical. Use keywords and project management terminology that align with the job requirements.

Choose a simple and easy-to-read design for your resume. Use short bullet points to convey critical information. Limit your resume to one or two pages and update the format to reflect only the last ten to fifteen years of relevant experience.

Ensure that the following sections are included in your resume:

- Contact Information
- Professional Summary

Update each section with your latest proficiencies, accomplishments, and experience.

### Professional Summary

The Professional Summary section provides a brief introduction of yourself and should state why you are the best candidate for the position. Merge the job's description with your past experience, highlighting unique expertise that makes you valuable to the company.

This section is a bulleted list of your most relevant skills for the job you are applying for. Use the job description to find core competencies you possess and align them with the bullet points in this section.
